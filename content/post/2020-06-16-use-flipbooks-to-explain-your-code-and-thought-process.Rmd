# Learning R's `%>%`

Using the pipe operator (`%>%`) is one of my favorite things about coding in R and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). However when it was first shown to me, I couldn't understand what the [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typed_query) nut describing it was *so enthusiastic* about. They tried to explain, "It means *and then* do the next operation." When that didn't click for me, they continued (while becoming ever more excited) "It *passes the previous steps output into the first argument* of the next function," still... `r emo::ji("deadpan")``r  emo::ji("deadpan")``r emo::ji("confused")`. 
Self-evident verbs in their code like `select()`, `filter()`, `summarise()` helped me nod along, partly following the operations. Though it wasn't until I evaluated the code *line-by-line* that I recognized the pipe's elegance, power, beauty, simplicity `r emo::ji("smile")`!

Now, a few years and reads through [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) later^[See my notes and solutions [here]( https://brshallo.github.io/r4ds_solutions/).], I will often share my work by keeping the code and output together and showing, line-by-line, what I am building towards. For example when...

... giving a 2019 talk on *"Managing objects in analytics workflows, using lists as columns in dataframes"*:

... giving a 2017 talk on *"Getting started with 'tidy' data science in R"*:

... promoting a recent blog post on *"Tidy pairwise operations"* (though in this case I removed the code):

><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What is your <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidyverse?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#tidyverse</a> (or other <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> ) approach for doing arbitrary pairwise operations across variables? Mine is frequently something like:<br><br>I. nest...<br>II. expand combos... <br>III. filter...<br>IV. map fun(s)...<br>...<br><br>I wrote a post walking through this: <a href="https://t.co/xRnRf5yh3m">https://t.co/xRnRf5yh3m</a> <a href="https://t.co/Zvxey2gm3H">pic.twitter.com/Zvxey2gm3H</a></p>&mdash; Bryan Shalloway (@brshallo) <a href="https://twitter.com/brshallo/status/1271194908477591553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

However each of these examples were built using PowerPoint (and a lot of copy and pasting of code + output). The series of images cannot be easily reproduced. In this post I'll point to resources on how to create these sorts of code communication materials in ways that *are reproducible*.

# Flipbooks

When I started writing this post, I planned to call this type of output a "**LEXPREX**" for "**L**ine-by-line **EX**ecution with **PR**inted **EX**amples" (and a name evocative of the inspiring [reprex](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex) package by [Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan])^[I also considered names such as `pexprex`, `sexprex`, `pripex`, ... I'll let the reader guess at the acronyms.]). But, thankfully, an excellent solution containing thorough explanations (and a much better name) already existed, *flipbooks*. 

As described in the [flipbookr documentation](https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/about), “flipbooks are tools that present side-by-side, aligned, incremental code-output."

![(Example inspired by 'Many Models' chapter of 'R For Data Science' by Grolemund & Wickham.)](https://github.com/brshallo/flipbookr-gifs-examples/raw/master/example-r4ds.gif?raw=true )

At this point you should stop reading this blog and instead go learn about [flipbookr](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr). My post was largely written before I learned about this package. Hence, starting at [this presentation](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/flipbooks-evangeline-reynolds/) by [Gina Reynolds](https://twitter.com/EvaMaeRey) or `flipbookr`'s [about page](https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/about) will generally be a more productive use of your time. The remainder of this post discusses either tools adjacent to flipbooks or describes workflows that can also be found within `flipbookr` documentation.

# Example with xaringan

The [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package for making slideshows contains highlighting features (and is what `flipbookr` is built-on). For highlighting *code* you can use the trailing comment `#<<`^[Which I prefer over the alternatives of using the leading `*` or wrapping the message in`{{}}`.]. For highlighting *output* there is the `highlight.output` code chunk option.

[Mitchell O'Hara-Wild](https://twitter.com/mitchoharawild)'s 2019 presentation on *"Flexible futures for [fable](https://github.com/tidyverts/fable) functionality"* contains a helpful example where he uses these features to walk-through [his code](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/fable-combinations-2019/blob/6a55628e1ad156c0040676b7881a799f7f75370a/user2019/index.Rmd).

See [More sophisticated highlighting] if your use-case requires more than line-level highlighting.

# Animating a flipbook

I sometimes want to convert a flipbook into a gif, e.g. when sharing an example in a README or a snippet of a concept on social media. If you ignored my prior entreaty, this is a second reminder to stop and go read about `flipbookr`. The [template file](https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/about) now shows how to create gifs using `flipbookr` (html) --> `pagedown` (pdf) --> `magick` (gif). I also describe this workflow and provide examples [here](https://github.com/brshallo/flipbookr-gifs-examples), e.g.

![(Example from a prior blog post, "Riddler Solutions: Pedestrian Puzzles")](https://github.com/brshallo/flipbookr-gifs-examples/raw/master/example-riddler-solution.gif)

# Closing note

I recommend exploring the [Rstudio Education blog](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/). The site contains helpful resources for improving your technical communication. It was here that I stumbled on the post [Decorate your R code with flair](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/05/flair/). Reading this inspired me to make a first attempt at building a reproducible animation of line-by-line execution of R code (something I'd been wanting to do for ages). The positive response & feedback to my initial tweet led me to learn about `flipbookr` and motivated additional actions (described in [Engagement & contributions]) including the review and completion of this blog post.

Finally, please go enjoy the beautiful examples you can find at the `flipbookr` [about page](https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/about):

# Appendix

## More sophisticated highlighting

For more sophisticated highlighting of *code*, use the [flair package](https://github.com/kbodwin/flair). I'm not sure what to recommend for highlighting changes in *output* to the console... perhaps [diffobj](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj) would be an option. You could also just explicitly format the output, e.g. using  [gt](https://github.com/rstudio/gt) or [kableExtra](https://github.com/haozhu233/kableExtra) for tabular outputs, or using geoms, annotations, etc. in [ggplot](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2)s. And, of course, you can always dive into the html.

## Engagement & contributions

Blogging is time consuming. Reaching out to package maintainers or making contributions (even small ones) on open-source software projects can be intimidating. As a *tiny* success story, I documented actions that stemmed (in some part) from engaging with the #rstats online communities while working on this blog post topic:

* While this post was in draft form, I tweeted out my initial approach (that used the [flair](https://github.com/kbodwin/flair) package). 
    * The next step might have been trying to improve upon this. Thankfully, instead, [Kelly Bodwin](https://twitter.com/KellyBodwin) pointed me to `flipbookr`! 

><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">P.S. <br><br>The `flair_lines()` function lets you highlight whole line(s) if you want! <br><br>{flipbookr} is a better option for making gifs/slides like this, but {flair} + {pagedown} + {magick} might help if you want specialty or layered highlighting.</p>&mdash; Kelly Bodwin (@KellyBodwin) <a href="https://twitter.com/KellyBodwin/status/1272741205365764097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

* Kelly also created an [issue](https://github.com/kbodwin/flair/issues/15) to further discuss possible integrations between `flair` and `flipbookr`.
* I remade my initial example using `flipbookr` ([see issue](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr/issues/22)). 
    * I first created an [issue](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr/issues/21) showing how to print `xaringan` slides incrementally using `pagedown::chrome_print()`.
        * Which helped to close a related [issue](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown/issues/110) on `xaringan`.
* Gina Reynolds made a variety of updates to `flipbookr`, one of which included adding the html --> pdf --> gif workflow to the template `r emo::ji("smile")`.
