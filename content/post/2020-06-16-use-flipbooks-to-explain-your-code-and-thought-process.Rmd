# Learning R's `%>%`

Using the pipe operator (`%>%`) is one of my favorite things about coding in R and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). However when it was first shown to me, I couldn't understand what the [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typed_query) nut describing it was *so enthusiastic* about. They tried to explain, "It means *and then* do the next operation." When that didn't click for me, they continued (while becoming ever more excited) "It *passes the previous steps output into the first argument* of the next function," still... `r emo::ji("deadpan")``r  emo::ji("deadpan")``r emo::ji("confused")`. 
Self-evident verbs in their code like `select()`, `filter()`, `summarise()` helped me nod along, partly following the operations. Though it wasn't until I evaluated the code *line-by-line* that I recognized the pipe's elegance, power, beauty, simplicity `r emo::ji("smile")`!

Now, a few years and reads through [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) later^[See my notes and solutions [here]( https://brshallo.github.io/r4ds_solutions/).], I will often share my work by keeping the code and output together and showing, line-by-line, what I am building towards. For example when...

... giving a 2019 talk on *"Managing objects in analytics workflows, using lists as columns in dataframes"*:

... giving a 2017 talk on *"Getting started with 'tidy' data science in R"*:

... promoting a recent blog post on *"Tidy pairwise operations"* (though in this case I removed the code):

><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What is your <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidyverse?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#tidyverse</a> (or other <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> ) approach for doing arbitrary pairwise operations across variables? Mine is frequently something like:<br><br>I. nest...<br>II. expand combos... <br>III. filter...<br>IV. map fun(s)...<br>...<br><br>I wrote a post walking through this: <a href="https://t.co/xRnRf5yh3m">https://t.co/xRnRf5yh3m</a> <a href="https://t.co/Zvxey2gm3H">pic.twitter.com/Zvxey2gm3H</a></p>&mdash; Bryan Shalloway (@brshallo) <a href="https://twitter.com/brshallo/status/1271194908477591553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

However each of these examples were built using PowerPoint (and a lot of copy and pasting of code + output). The series of images are not easily reproducible -- I can't recreate or share how I made these slides (at least not without going through another highly manual exercise). In this post, I'll point to resources on how to create these sorts of technical communication materials in ways that are reproducible.

# Flipbooks

When I started writing this post, I planned to call this type of output a "**LEXPREX**" for "**L**ine-by-line **EX**ecution with **PR**inted **EX**amples" (and a name evocative of the inspiring [reprex](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex) package by [Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan])^[I also considered names such as `pexprex`, `sexprex`, `pripex`, ... I'll let the reader guess at the acronyms.]). But, thankfully, an excellent solution containing thorough explanations (and a much better name) already existed, [flipbooks](https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/about). 

At this point you should stop reading this blog and instead go learn about [flipbookr](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr). My post was largely written before I learned about this package^[I just don't know how to "kill my darlings".]. Hence the next several sections discuss making flipbook-like solutions (but in ways that would require a great deal more copy-and-pasting of code to implement). See additional resources in tweet below.

><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow, thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/KellyBodwin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@KellyBodwin</a> for the recommendation. <a href="https://twitter.com/EvaMaeRey?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EvaMaeRey</a> üì¶ `flipbookr` is another incredible resource for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> education that will save me so much time. <br><br>- <a href="https://t.co/WB5jWIOg5h">https://t.co/WB5jWIOg5h</a><br>- <a href="https://t.co/z7NtBVASXl">https://t.co/z7NtBVASXl</a> <a href="https://t.co/9DEQUR1teY">https://t.co/9DEQUR1teY</a></p>&mdash; Bryan Shalloway (@brshallo) <a href="https://twitter.com/brshallo/status/1272761990025486336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

If you are still interested in reading about other (less elegant, less fully featured) approaches to building flipbook-like outputs, continue on.

# Example with xaringan

The [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package for making slideshows contains highlighting features (and is what `flipbookr` is built-on). For highlighting *code*, you can use the trailing comment `#<<`^[Which I prefer over the alternatives of using the leading `*` or wrapping the message in`{{}}`.]. For highlighting *output*, there is the `highlight.output` code chunk option.

[Mitchell O'Hara-Wild](https://twitter.com/mitchoharawild)'s 2019 presentation on *"Flexible futures for [fable](https://github.com/tidyverts/fable) functionality"* contains a helpful example where he uses these features to build a code walk-through ([source code](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/fable-combinations-2019/blob/6a55628e1ad156c0040676b7881a799f7f75370a/user2019/index.Rmd)).

See [More sophisticated highlighting] if your use-case requires more than line-level highlighting.

# Animating a flipbook

I sometimes want to convert a flipbook into a gif, e.g. for sharing an example in a README or on social media. If you ignored my prior entreaty, this is a second reminder to stop and go read about `flipbookr`, which contains the `code_create_gif_flipbook()` function. Just look at the beautiful gif thumbnails of flipbooks on the [about page](https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/about)!

**My initial approach (written prior to learning of `flipbookr`):**

If you read the source code at the link in the tweet below, you will see I use...

* [flair](https://github.com/kbodwin/flair) for the code highlighting
* [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) for the slides
* [pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown) to convert the html slides into pdf
* [magick](https://github.com/ropensci/magick) to convert the pdf into images, apply a few (hacky) transformations, and then stitch them together into a gif

><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">‚ù§Ô∏èflairüì¶by <a href="https://twitter.com/KellyBodwin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@KellyBodwin</a> for teaching <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> and explaining the %&gt;% in particular. Here&#39;s a quick example using: `flair` + `xaringan` --&gt; `pagedown` --&gt; `magick` to make a gif of expanding chain of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidyverse?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#tidyverse</a> operations: <a href="https://t.co/cSi858dFVa">https://t.co/cSi858dFVa</a> <br><br>(thx also <a href="https://twitter.com/xieyihui?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@xieyihui</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/opencpu?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@opencpu</a> ) <a href="https://t.co/7nvWDabKgm">pic.twitter.com/7nvWDabKgm</a></p>&mdash; Bryan Shalloway (@brshallo) <a href="https://twitter.com/brshallo/status/1272737172978905088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Next step would have been trying to think through a more programmatic way of building these slides and calling these steps. Thankfully, instead, [Kelly Bodwin](https://twitter.com/KellyBodwin) pointed me to `flipbookr` `r emo::ji("smile")`!

## Closing note

I highly recommend exploring the [Rstudio Education blog](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/). The site contains some enormously helpful resources for improving your technical communication. It was here that I stumbled on the post [Decorate your R code with flair](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/05/flair/) -- which inspired me to make a first attempt at building a reproducible animation of line-by-line execution of R code (something I'd been wanting to do for ages). The positive response and feedback of which led me to learn about `flipbookr` and inspired me to finish writing this blog post. 

# Appendix

## More sophisticated highlighting

For more sophisticated highlighting of *code*, use the [flair package](https://github.com/kbodwin/flair). I'm not sure what to recommend for highlighting changes in *output* to the console... perhaps [diffobj](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj) would be an option. You could also just explicitly format the output, e.g. using  [gt](https://github.com/rstudio/gt) or [kableExtra](https://github.com/haozhu233/kableExtra) for tabular outputs, or using geoms, annotations, etc. in [ggplot](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2)s. And, of course, you can always dive into the html.
