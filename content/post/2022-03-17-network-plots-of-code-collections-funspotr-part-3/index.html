<p>In previous posts and threads I’ve alluded to the potential utility of visualizing the relationships between parsed functions/packages and files as a network plot.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
It can be helpful to review the relationship between your <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> code files by looking at a network graph of them by packages loaded.<br><br>Graph of 50+ of my gists (squares) and packages (circles) used.<br><br>That node at the center is {dplyr}. <a href="https://t.co/XmNxOrgDtF">pic.twitter.com/XmNxOrgDtF</a>

<p>I added the function <code>network_plot()</code> to <a href="https://github.com/brshallo/funspotr">funspotr</a>. In this post I’ll simply output the network plots of the parsed-out packages from the code collections discussed in the prior two posts:</p>

<li>Similar to Julia’s posts, tidyverse packages are central to David’s Tidy Tuesday files.. However the tidymodels packages are less central and can be seen in a cluster at the bottom of the plot.</li>
<li>In both plots we see {broom} not showing-up by the other tidymodels packages. This is unsurprising for while broom is in the tidymodels ecosystem it has many common uses outside of predictive modeling and has a longer legacy than most tidymodels packages.</li>
