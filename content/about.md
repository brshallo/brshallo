*Schooling & Early Career:*

Bryan graduated with honors in Cognitive Neuroscience from Washington University in St. Louis where he also studied American Culture Studies and Political Science. He spent the majority of his high school and undergraduate summers in a Neuropathology research lab studying Alzheimer's disease. After graduating, he started his career as a high school math teacher in Durham Public Schools (North Carolina) through [Teach for America](https://www.teachforamerica.org/). Bryan moved into analytics through an [Education Pioneers](https://www.educationpioneers.org/) fellowship as a School Performance Analyst in Colorado and then returned to North Carolina where he completed a [Master's in Advanced Analytics](https://analytics.ncsu.edu/) from NC State University. 

*Career in Data Science:*

Bryan has been a Data Scientist at [NetApp](https://www.netapp.com/) in the Raleigh-Durham area since July of 2017. He has worked on a wide range of problems in customer support, sales, and pricing. Examples of his projects:

Bryan created this blog as a place to document some of his ideas and learning. He wanted to do so in a way that was consistent with the open tutorials, books, software, and communities he has learned from over the course of his career.
