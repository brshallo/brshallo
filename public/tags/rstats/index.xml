      <description>Function expecting one columnFunctions allowing multiple columnsOlder approachesAppendixdplyr, the foundational tidyverse package, makes a trade-off between being easy to code in interactively at the expense of being more difficult to create functions with. The source of the trade-off is in how dplyr evaluates column names (specifically, allowing for unquoted column names as argument inputs). Tidy evaluation has been under major development the last couple of years in order to make programming with dplyr easier.</description>

      <description>Learning R‚Äôs %&amp;gt;%Using the pipe operator (%&amp;gt;%) is one of my favorite things about coding in R and the tidyverse. However when it was first shown to me, I couldn‚Äôt understand what the #rstats nut describing it was so enthusiastic about. They tried to explain, ‚ÄúIt means and then do the next operation.‚Äù When that didn‚Äôt click for me, they continued (while becoming ever more excited) ‚ÄúIt passes the previous steps output into the first argument of the next function,‚Äù still‚Ä¶ üòêüòêüòï.</description>
