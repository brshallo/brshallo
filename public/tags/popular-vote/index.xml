      <description>In this post I discuss using a national popular vote weighted by the electoral college for presidential elections. This approach would empower voters by expanding political influence outside of ‘battleground states.’ It would also preserve the existing biases built into the American electoral college (thereby making such a system legislatively palatable across party affiliations). This post presents some potential merits of a weighted national popular vote – it does not represent an endorsement.</description>
