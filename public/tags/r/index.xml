      <description>What influeces price?How have influential factors changed over time?Identify abnormalities / abnormalities?AppendixPricing challengesDataset considerationsRegularization and colinear variables“All models are wrong, some models are useful.” -“Tukey”
Setting prices for large complicated products is challenging, particularly in business to business (B2B) contexts. B2B sellers may lack information, e.g. accurate ‘street’ prices for the various configurations of their products. However they typically do have historical data on internal sales transactions as well as leadership with a strong desire for insights into pricing behavior.</description>

      <description>Riddler expressRiddler classicAppendixTime to centerTransform grid, rotate firstTransform city, prettyThis post contains solutions to FiveThirtyEight’s two riddles released 2020-02-14, Riddler Express and Riddler Classic. I created a toy package animatrixr to help with some of the visualizations and computations for my solutions1.
Riddler expressThe riddle:
Riddler City is a large circular metropolis, with countless square city blocks that each have a side length of 1 km.</description>

      <description>This post is a continuation on my post from last week on Visualizing Matrix Transformations with gganimate. Both posts are largely inspired by Grant Sanderson’s beautiful video series The Essence of Linear Algebra and wanting to continue messing around with Thomas Lin Peterson’s fantastic gganimate package in R.
As with the last post, I’ll describe trying to (very loosely) recreate a small part of the visualizations showing the geometry of matrix multiplication and changing basis vectors (using gganimate in R).</description>
