It’s mostly one of computer/tablet/phone/tv1. These are largely platforms the user owns or controls. I’m surprised we don’t yet have more interactions with screens out in the world.

However when it was first shown to me, I couldn’t understand what the #rstats nut describing it was so enthusiastic about. They tried to explain, “It means and then do the next operation.” When that didn’t click for me, they continued (while becoming ever more excited) “It passes the previous steps output into the first argument of the next function,” still… 😐😐😕.</description>
