      <description>In this post I will discuss using a national popular vote weighted by the electoral college as a method to elect the president. This approach would empower voters by expanding political influence outside of ‘battleground states.’ It would also preserve the existing biases inherent in the American electoral college (thereby making such a system legislatively palatable across party affiliations). This post presents a discussion of the merits of such an electoral system – it does not represent an endorsement.</description>
