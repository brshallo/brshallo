      <description>DataOverviewI. Nest and pivotII. Expand combinationsIII. Filter redundanciesIV. Perform operation(s)V. Bind back to dataFunctionalizeWhen is this approach innapropriate?AppendixInteractions example, tidymodelsExpand via joinNested tibblesPivot and then summariseSession infoSay you want to map an operation or list of operations across all two-way1 combinations of a set of variables/columns in a dataframe. For example, you may be doing feature engineering and want to create a set of interaction terms, ratios, etc.</description>

      <description>Riddler expressRiddler classicAppendixTime to centerTransform grid, rotate firstTransform city, prettyThis post contains solutions to FiveThirtyEight’s two riddles released 2020-02-14, Riddler Express and Riddler Classic. I created a toy package animatrixr to help with some of the visualizations and computations for my solutions1.
Riddler expressThe riddle:
Riddler City is a large circular metropolis, with countless square city blocks that each have a side length of 1 km.</description>

      <description>I highly recommend the fantastic video series Essence of Linear Algebra by Grant Sanderson. In this post I’ll walk through how you can use gganimate and the tidyverse to (very loosely) recreate some of the visualizations shown in that series. Specifically those on matrix transformations and changing the basis vectors1.

This post is an offshoot of a post of my solutions to this week’s FiveThirtyEight Riddler. To support my solution, I was trying to visualize matrix transformations.</description>
