      <description>Riddler expressRiddler classicAppendixTime to centerTransform city, prettyThis post contains solutions to FiveThirtyEight’s two riddles released 2020-02-14, Riddler Express and Riddler Classic. I used animatrixr (a toy package I wrote) to help with some of the visualizations and computations for this post. For more details on animating matrix transformations see my posts here and here.
Riddler expressThe riddle:
Riddler City is a large circular metropolis, with countless square city blocks that each have a side length of 1 km.</description>

      <description>I highly recommend the fantastic video series Essence of Linear Algebra by Grant Sanderson. In this post I’ll walk through how you can use gganimate and the tidyverse to (very loosely) recreate some of the visualizations shown in that series. Specifically those on matrix transformations and changing the basis vectors1.

This post is an offshoot of an (upcoming) post of my solutions to this week’s FiveThirtyEight Riddler. To support my solution, I was trying to visualize matrix transformations.</description>
