<p>I have been coleading an internal study group going on Pricing Strategy. We just finished week 4 of a Coursera course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/uva-darden-bcg-pricing-strategy-customer-value/home/week/4">Customer Value in Pricing Strategy</a> devoted entirely to the various conditions under which people behave ‘irrationally’<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and how/when to use these conditions<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> to demand a higher price on your product. While going through the materials I had an idea for a new casino game.</p>
<p>There are a few psychological phenomena from the course that are important primers:</p>
<p>I. People tend to be <em>risk seeking</em> when facing <strong>losses</strong> but <em>risk averse</em> when facing <strong>gains</strong>.</p>
<p>The example they give in the course is that faced with the scenario below (where each option has the same expected value), people will tend to go for the sure thing to gain the $50.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Image of risk seeking</code></pre>
<p>However in the case of facing a loss, they will tend to prefer testing their chances and taking the riskier option of a 50% chance of losing $100.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># image of risk avoiding</code></pre>
<p>Another psychological phenomena described is:</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
<li>People tend to prefer <em>disaggregated</em> gains but <em>aggregated</em> losses</li>
</ol>
<p>People prefer multiple small good things happening to them over just a single good thing occurring (even if the total value of events is equal). For example, people will prefer winning two small scratch cards over winning a single large scratch card:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># example scratch card</code></pre>
<p>However people prefer taking bad events in aggregated forms. For example they prefer receiving one large bill over receiving multiple smaller bills:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># example bills</code></pre>
<p>Even though the value of these events is equal<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

<h1>Implications For Gambling</h1>
<p>Casinos are master psychological manipulators. However many lotteries, slots, and other games run counter to these particular phenomena. They offer repeated gauranteed initial losses (the quarter you put into the machine, the scratch ticket you buy from the counter, etc.) for the chance at a large payoff (winning the jackpot)<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I thought an interesting set-up for a game would be one that flipped this and made the player <em>very</em> likely to win a small amount each time they played but that always carried the risk of a single large loss<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As an example, imagine a roullette-like wheel numbered from 1 to 30. You are instructed to pick a number and as long as you <em>don’t</em> land on the selected number, you win $5 but if you <em>do</em> land on it you lose $150<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>. This particular game and bet would yield the casino an expected value of a little under 17 cents<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>. It also yields the player an expected 30 wins in a row<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>. The advert for the game might focus on the idea of “Tempting Fate.”<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>You might course mix and match the ideas of a ‘big loss’ and a ‘big win’. Carrying on from the previous example the board (numbered 1:30) could be set-up where the player picks a big win spot ($150 gain), two big losing spots ($150 loss for either), and the rest all result in small wins ($5), the expected value for the casino is now $0.50.</p>
<p>There are a variety of forms this game could take (it doesn’t have to be a roullette-like wheel) the novel phenomena is to focus on ensuring players get repeated small wins while having them pay their losses in one-off large chunks.</p>

<li id="fn9"><p>Many casino games could be redesigned in this manner – where you are likely to win but always face the risk of a large loss. You might picture a room in the casino that had an ‘Upside Down’ style feel where all the slots and similar games there were reconstructed accordingly.</p>
