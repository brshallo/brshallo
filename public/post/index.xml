Setting prices for large complicated products is challenging, particularly in business to business (B2B) contexts. B2B sellers may lack information, e.g.¬†accurate ‚Äòstreet‚Äô prices for the various configurations of their products. However they typically do have historical data on internal sales transactions as well as leadership with a strong desire for insights into pricing behavior.</description>

      <description>Function expecting one columnFunctions allowing multiple columnsOlder approachesAppendixdplyr, the foundational tidyverse package, makes a trade-off between being easy to code in interactively at the expense of being more difficult to create functions with. The source of the trade-off is in how dplyr evaluates column names (specifically, allowing for unquoted column names as argument inputs). Tidy evaluation has been under major development the last couple of years in order to make programming with dplyr easier.</description>

      <description>Learning R‚Äôs %&amp;gt;%Using the pipe operator (%&amp;gt;%) is one of my favorite things about coding in R and the tidyverse. However when it was first shown to me, I couldn‚Äôt understand what the #rstats nut describing it was so enthusiastic about. They tried to explain, ‚ÄúIt means and then do the next operation.‚Äù When that didn‚Äôt click for me, they continued (while becoming ever more excited) ‚ÄúIt passes the previous steps output into the first argument of the next function,‚Äù still‚Ä¶ üòêüòêüòï.</description>

      <description>This post is a continuation on my post from last week on Visualizing Matrix Transformations with gganimate. Both posts are largely inspired by Grant Sanderson‚Äôs beautiful video series The Essence of Linear Algebra and wanting to continue messing around with Thomas Lin Peterson‚Äôs fantastic gganimate package in R.
As with the last post, I‚Äôll describe trying to (very loosely) recreate a small part of the visualizations showing the geometry of matrix multiplication and changing basis vectors (using gganimate in R).</description>

      <description>I highly recommend the fantastic video series Essence of Linear Algebra by Grant Sanderson. In this post I‚Äôll walk through how you can use gganimate and the tidyverse to (very loosely) recreate some of the visualizations shown in that series. Specifically those on matrix transformations and changing the basis vectors1.

This post is an offshoot of a post of my solutions to this week‚Äôs FiveThirtyEight Riddler. To support my solution, I was trying to visualize matrix transformations.</description>
