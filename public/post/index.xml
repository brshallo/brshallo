      <title>A National Popular Vote Weighted by the Electoral College</title>

      <description>In this post I discuss using a national popular vote weighted by the electoral college to elect the president. This approach would empower voters by expanding political influence outside of ‚Äòbattleground states.‚Äô It would also preserve the existing biases built into the American electoral college (thereby making such a system legislatively palatable across party affiliations and electoral college traditionalists)1.
Irrespective of political party or disposition towards direct democracy, the winner-take-all approach (currently applied by most US states to allocate their electoral votes for the president) has clear drawbacks.</description>

      <description>Function expecting one columnFunctions allowing multiple columnsOlder approachesAppendixdplyr, the foundational tidyverse package, makes a trade-off between being easy to code in interactively at the expense of being more difficult to create functions with. The source of the trade-off is in how dplyr evaluates column names (specifically, allowing for unquoted column names as argument inputs). Tidy evaluation has been under major development the last couple of years in order to make programming with dplyr easier.</description>

      <description>Learning R‚Äôs %&amp;gt;%Using the pipe operator (%&amp;gt;%) is one of my favorite things about coding in R and the tidyverse. However when it was first shown to me, I couldn‚Äôt understand what the #rstats nut describing it was so enthusiastic about. They tried to explain, ‚ÄúIt means and then do the next operation.‚Äù When that didn‚Äôt click for me, they continued (while becoming ever more excited) ‚ÄúIt passes the previous steps output into the first argument of the next function,‚Äù still‚Ä¶ üòêüòêüòï.</description>

      <description>This post is a continuation on my post from last week on Visualizing Matrix Transformations with gganimate. Both posts are largely inspired by Grant Sanderson‚Äôs beautiful video series The Essence of Linear Algebra and wanting to continue messing around with Thomas Lin Peterson‚Äôs fantastic gganimate package in R.
As with the last post, I‚Äôll describe trying to (very loosely) recreate a small part of the visualizations showing the geometry of matrix multiplication and changing basis vectors (using gganimate in R).</description>

      <description>I highly recommend the fantastic video series Essence of Linear Algebra by Grant Sanderson. In this post I‚Äôll walk through how you can use gganimate and the tidyverse to (very loosely) recreate some of the visualizations shown in that series. Specifically those on matrix transformations and changing the basis vectors1.

This post is an offshoot of a post of my solutions to this week‚Äôs FiveThirtyEight Riddler. To support my solution, I was trying to visualize matrix transformations.</description>

      <description>I did my best to convince Britney and my parents that we should start the morning with a ‚Äòpolar bear plunge‚Äô in the ocean but was unsuccessful in convincing anyone (including myself) to participate. We slept in and had a relaxing morning before leaving the Airbnb at around 12PM.
We headed to the Perlan, where we‚Äôd had dinner a few nights prior and which also served as the city‚Äôs science center1.</description>

      <description>We were out the door by 7:45AM and headed for the Blue Lagoon (where my parents had offered to treat us for the day). The regular Blue Lagoon pool had sold-out of tickets. Instead, we were ‚Äòforced‚Äô to get tickets to the Blue Lagoon Spa Retreat ‚Äì setting the stage for the most luxurious four hours of my life.

In addition to access to the main lagoon, the retreat included four secluded winding pools that were perfect for laying back and slowly floating down.</description>

      <description>Britney and I awoke several times in the night to the frigid cold. We would run across the street to a patch of trees where we could relieve ourselves and get away from the streetlights. I looked up to the stars and the clear night sky clinging faintly to a hope that whatever damage might be done to the car, it was all part of a plan for us to be at this exact point.</description>

      <description>We slept in a little later this morning (930AM), had Skyr parfaits with mom and dad for breakfast and more croissants from Brau√∞ &amp;amp; Co.¬†We drove back to the UNESCO World heritage site, Thingvellier, that we‚Äôd attempted to visit the morning before. We arrived close to sunrise (there was no creepy white pickup truck in the parking lot this time).
The drive out was beautiful and easy. The browning grass and gnarled branches by the road seemed almost a pastoral desert (except for all the wetness).</description>

      <description>I grabbed an assortment of croissants from Brau√∞ &amp;amp; Co, half a block from our apartment. We were on the road headed East by 7:05AM.
The morning was strikingly dark. Clouds obscured any starlight. A soft rain made everything reflective. Faint glimpses of small trees and twisted wooden branches looked like alien figures on the side of the road. I drove nervously, stooping over the wheel like my dad had the morning before.</description>

      <description>My parents, Britney and I landed in Reykjavik at 630AM. We‚Äôd taken an eight-and-a-half-hour overnight flight from Seattle. It was dark when we stepped off the plane and would remain dark until 11AM (in wintertime Iceland only gets 4-6 hours of sunlight a day).
I packed the bags into haphazard piles that poured over the rear storage area of our rented Nissan X-trail. The air was a cold mix of rain and mist.</description>
