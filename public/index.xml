I created a toy package animatrixr to help with some of the visualizations and computations for my solutions1.
Riddler expressThe riddle:
Riddler City is a large circular metropolis, with countless square city blocks that each have a side length of 1 km.</description>

      <description>This post is a continuation on my post from last week on Visualizing Matrix Transformations with gganimate. Both posts are largely inspired by Grant Sanderson’s beautiful video series The Essence of Linear Algebra and wanting to continue messing around with Thomas Lin Peterson’s fantastic gganimate package in R.
As with the last post, I’ll describe trying to (very loosely) recreate a small part of the visualizations showing the geometry of matrix multiplication and changing basis vectors (using gganimate in R).</description>

      <description>I highly recommend the fantastic video series Essence of Linear Algebra by Grant Sanderson. In this post I’ll walk through how you can use gganimate and the tidyverse to (very loosely) recreate some of the visualizations shown in that series. Specifically those on matrix transformations and changing the basis vectors1.

This post is an offshoot of a post of my solutions to this week’s FiveThirtyEight Riddler. To support my solution, I was trying to visualize matrix transformations.</description>
